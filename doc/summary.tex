OTPO is a pretty new project. There are lots of enhancements and additional
functionalities that can be added:
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding more benchmarks for the user to choose from (AMB, OSU...)
\item Adding more criteria to base the results on (bandwidth, memory,
  collectives...)
\item Implement a result gathering tool, that takes the results file, and
  presents it to the user in a more readable and interpretable manner.
\item Using methods of sampling to reduce the space of values that need to be
  tested and reduce the number of end results due to the fact that those
  numbers can be huge for any tool to interpret and of course for the user to
  just look at.
\end{itemize}
