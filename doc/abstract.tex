The constant increase of complexity of clustered high performance
computing environments entails resource-intensive tuning to exploit
the capabilities of the given hardware and software environment. In
this paper, we introduce the Open Tool for Parameter Optimization
(OTPO), a new framework for optimizing Open MPI runtime
parameters. Based on running MPI benchmarks, the tool will test large
sets of run-time parameter combinations provided in a user-specified
input file and return the parameter sets leading to the best overall
performance. This paper presents implementation details, the current
status of the tool, an an example optimizing Open MPI's tunable
InfiniBand parameters to minimize the communication latency.
