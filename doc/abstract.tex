In this paper, a new tool will be introduced. OTPO (Open Tool for Parameter
Optimization) is the new tool donated to the Open MPI (Message Passing
Interface) project. OTPO is an Open MPI specific tool that is meant to explore
the MCA parameter space of Open MPI. The user would enter a file with a list
of parameters and possible values, and the tool would output a number of
combinations of the parameters' values that were found to be the best for a
certain criteria (latency, bandwidth, etc...). The purpose of OTPO is to give the
user an idea about the dependancy between the parameters themselves and an
ideal space of parameter combinations. This paper will be a current status
report on the work that have been done on OTPO.
