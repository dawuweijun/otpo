The constant increase of complexity of clustered high performance computing environments entails resource-intensive tuning to exploit the capabilities of the given hardware and software environment. In this paper, we introduce OTPO (Open Tool for Parameter Optimization), a new tool for optimizing Open MPI runtime parameters. Based on an application benchmark, the tool will test all viable combinations of Open MPI parameters provided in a user-specified input file and return the parameter sets leading to the best overall performance. This paper presents implementation details, the current status of the tool as well as an example optimizing the InfiniBand parameters of Open MPI in order to minimize the communication latency.
