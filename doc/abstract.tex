Clustered computing environments, although becoming the predominant
high-performance computing platform of choice, continue to grow in
complexity.  
%
It is relatively easy to achieve {\em good} performance with
real-world MPI applications on such platforms, but obtaining the best
possible MPI performance is still an extremely difficult task,
requiring painstaking tuning of all levels of the hardware and
software in the system.
%
The Open Tool for Parameter Optimization (OTPO) is a new framework
designed to aid in the optimization of one of the key software layers in
high performance computing: Open MPI.
%
OTPO systematically tests large numbers of combinations of Open MPI's
run-time tunable parameters for common communication patterns and
performance metrics to determine the ``best'' set for a given
platform.
%
This paper presents the implementation details and the current status of
the tool, as well as an example optimizing InfiniBand message passing
latency by Open MPI.
